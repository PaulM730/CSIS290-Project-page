Here are the primary keyboard shortcuts for taking screenshots on Windows 10/11:
Windows Key + Shift + S (Recommended): Opens the Snipping Tool menu. You can drag to select a rectangular area, free-form area, window, or full screen. The capture is copied to your clipboard.
Windows Key + PrtScn: Captures your entire screen and automatically saves the image file in Pictures > Screenshots.
PrtScn (Print Screen): Captures the entire screen and copies it to the clipboard. You must paste (Ctrl + V) this into an app like Paint or Word.
Alt + PrtScn: Captures only the active window and copies it to the clipboard.
Fn + Windows + Spacebar: An alternative for laptops lacking a PrtScn key, which saves the full screen.
